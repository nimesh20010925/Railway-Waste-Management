# Railway-Waste-Management
# 🚆 Intelligent Multi-Robot IoT-Based Waste Management System for Railway Stations

## 📌 Project Overview
Railway stations experience large passenger volumes, especially during peak hours, making manual waste collection unsafe, inefficient, and labor-intensive. This research proposes an **intelligent, time-aware, multi-robot waste management system** designed to automate garbage collection, classification, and monitoring while minimizing human involvement.

The system integrates **CCTV-based crowd analysis**, a **mobile garbage-collecting robot with intelligent navigation**, a **stationary robotic waste classification arm**, and a **mobile notification application**. By avoiding peak crowd periods and automating waste handling, the solution improves hygiene, safety, and operational efficiency in railway station environments.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Identify crowded and non-crowded time periods using CCTV-based headcount analysis  
- Schedule garbage collection during less crowded periods to ensure safety  
- Enable autonomous garbage collection using a mobile robot  
- Detect and classify garbage using vision-based machine learning models (YOLOv8)  
- Monitor categorized bin fill levels in real time  
- Notify cleaning staff through a mobile application when bins are full  


## 🔁 End-to-End System Workflow
1. **Crowd Detection Phase**  
   CCTV camera feeds are analyzed to estimate passenger headcount. Crowded time windows are identified and excluded from robot operation.

2. **Collection Scheduling Phase**  
   Garbage collection tasks are scheduled during less crowded periods to avoid interference with passengers.

3. **Mobile Robot Navigation & Collection Phase**  
   The mobile robot navigates station environments using obstacle avoidance and efficient navigation logic. A custom-trained **YOLOv8 model** assists in identifying garbage items to be collected. Detected garbage is collected and stored in the robot’s internal bin.

4. **Garbage Transfer Phase**  
   When the internal bin reaches a threshold, the mobile robot moves to the stationary sorting station and unloads garbage beneath the robotic arm.

5. **Waste Identification & Classification Phase**  
   The stationary robotic arm captures images of individual garbage items using an ESP32-CAM. A **YOLOv8-based classification model** categorizes waste into:
   - Plastic  
   - Paper  
   - Glass  
   - Unidentified waste  

   The arm places items into **four corresponding disposal bins**.

6. **Bin Monitoring Phase**  
   Sensors continuously monitor fill levels of each disposal bin.

7. **Notification Phase**  
   When any bin reaches its threshold, a real-time notification is sent to cleaning staff via the mobile application.
